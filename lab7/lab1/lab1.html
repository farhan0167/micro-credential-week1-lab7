		<p> Hi everyone! I'm a senior at Baruch College currently studying in Computer Information System. I chose this micro credential to expand my skill in web development and learn more about the backend development and javascript. I'm also interested in expanding my network which will help me in my job hunt leading up to my graduation in May.
